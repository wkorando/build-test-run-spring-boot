# Build, Test, Run, Spring Boot in the Cloud

Workshop stepping through building, testing, and running spring boot in the cloud.

## Exercise 1 REST in Spring

Using Spring Boot and Spring MVC see how you can quickly build a RESTful API.

Using MockMvc we will test our API so as we make changes to it, we don't accidentally introduce breaking changes.

## Exercise 2 Living in the Cloud

Let's build a CI/CD pipeline, so that as we make changes to our RESTful API, our application is updated

## Exercise 3 Making CRUD less cruddy with Spring Data

Every organization is going to need to persist data at some point. Let's explore how Spring Data and JPA make this task a lot less painful.

## Exercise 4 Securing your services with Spring Security

Production is a dangerous place, let's see how to limit access to your application's sweet sweet data by ensuring only the appropriate people can use your application.

## Exercise 5 Observability & Reliability

Rather you are building microserivces or monoliths you are going to want to know the health of your serivce and for it to not topple at the first sign of trouble. Let's see how Spring Boot addresses these concerns. 

## Excerise 6 A Message in a Boot

Synchronous communication in a distributed application can quickly tax a system's resources. Let's see how to setup asychronous communication to allow over-taxed resources a chance to catch up, without degrading the experience for client's. 

## Exercise 7 Configuration in the Cloud 

Being able to rapidly reconfigure application's as well as securely store credentials to resources like a database is essential th the modern web. Let see how we can accomplish both with Spring Cloud Config.
